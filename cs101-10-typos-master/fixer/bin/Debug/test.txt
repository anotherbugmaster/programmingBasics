irritated
harry
much
that
yearned
throwgadding
with

trailed
away
hopefully
they
reached

when
harry
pushed

open
fang
went
with

they
followed
steady

spiders
moving
along

they
walked
behind
them
about
twenty
minutes
speaking
listening
hard
noises
other
than
breaking
twigs
rustling
leaves
then
when
trees
become
thicker
than
ever
that
stars
overhead
were
longer

this
said
they
followed
darting
shadows
spiders
into
trees
they
couldn
move
very
quickly
there
were
tree
roots
stumps
their
barely
visible
near
blackness
harry
could
feel
fang
breath
hand
more
than
once
they
stop
that
harry
could
crouch
down
find
spiders
wandlight
they
walked
what
seemed
like
least
half
hour
their
robes
snagging
slung
branches
brambles
after
while
they
noticed
that
ground
seemed
sloping
downward
though
trees
were
thick
ever
then
fang
suddenly
loose
great
echoing
bark
making
both
harry
jump
their
skins
what
said
loudly
looking
around
into

dark
gripping
harry
elbow
very
hard
there
something
moving

darkness
seemed
pressing
their

they
stood
terrified
waiting
there
strange
rumbling
noise
then
silence
what
think
doing
said
harry
probably
getting
ready
pounce
said
they
waited
shivering
hardly
daring
