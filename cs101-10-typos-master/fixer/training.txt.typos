closer
book
read
magic
people
more
commonly
known
muggles
were
particularly
afraid
magic
medieval
times
very
good
recognizing
rare
occasion
that
they
catch
real
witch
wizard
burning
effect
whatsoever
witch
wizard
would
perform
basic
flame
freezing
charm
then
pretend
shriek
with
pain
while
enjoying

indeed

harry

slowly
very
carefully
unscrewed

probably
find

that
harry
never
enjoyed

holiadys
uncle
vernon
aunt
petunia
their
dudley
were
harry
only
living
relatives
they
were
muggles
they
very
medieval
attitude
toward

harry
dead

been
witch
wizard
themselves
were
never
mentioned
under
dursleys
roof
years
aunt
petunia
uncle
vernon
hoped
that
they
kept
harry
downtrodden
possible
they
would
able
squash
magic
their
fury
they
been
unsuccessful
these
days
they
lived
terror
anyone
finding
that
harry
spent
most
last

most
they
could
however
lock
away
harry
spellbooks
wand
cauldron
broomstick
start
summer
break
forbid
talk
neighbors
this
separation
from
spellbooks
been
real
problem
harry
because
teachers
hogwarts
given
holiday
work
essays
particularly
nasty
about
shrinking
potions
harry
least
favorite
teacher
professor
snape
would
delighted
have
excuse
give
harry
detention

harry
therefore
seized
chance
